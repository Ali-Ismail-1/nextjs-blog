## Hello World
Hello World, I am pre-rendering my pages using static generation with next. Jas
I am going to store all of my findings and learnings on this blog so that the world can benefit from what I’m learning, I hope you find this very interesting and fun. 
I want to make this a fun and experience that you will enjoy. 

Again, welcome to the Ali Ismail blog. 


## Next.JS

I have cloned a Blog template and I'm updating it with my own post. The files that I'm updating are in markdown AKA “MD” files.
