What is Markdown?

Markdown is a language that allows you to format plain text documents. It's simple, easy, and compatible with a plethora of use cases in this highly rapidly evolving world we live in.

You can use it with websites, documents, notes, presentations, email, and documentation such as GitHub. 

It's very powerful to learn a few rules that opens up the doors to interacting with most things electronic. Markdown syntax is supported by website tools, document oriented tools, notes, presentations, and email. And even when you need to look at markdown on the plain text file it is very easy to read.


I am using markdown in this blog. And here's some basic syntax that you should be familiar with.

`# Header` will produce a Header 1 as follows: 

# Header

`## Header` will produce a Header 2 as follows: 

## Header

and so on

`**bold**` generates bold text: **bold**

`*italics*` generates italicized text: *italics*

You can create unordered lists simply by putting dashes before each line item like so

```
- Unordered
- list
- Of items
```

Which will produce something like this: 
 - Unordered
 - list
 - Of items

And ordered lists you guessed it, are made like this:
```
1. Ordered
2. List
3. Of Items
```

Here is a preview of what this would look like:

 1. Ordered
 2. List
 3. Of Items

And you can make urls by using the following syntax
```
Click [text](url)
```
which would allow you to make links like so:
